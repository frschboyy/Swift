# Owner checks: the overlay, conversations and corrections (ADR-012, ADR-013 phase A)

About 15 minutes, in your real Swift with your real microphone. Run them in order.

- Each check says **what to do**, **what you should see**, and what the log report checks afterwards.
- Note anything that looks wrong and roughly when, e.g. "check 3 at 20:15".

## Before you start

1. In `config.yaml`:
   - `debug: false`
   - `wake: enabled: true`
   - `connectors: calendar: google`
   - a contact for yourself, as in the email check before.
2. Restart Swift: Tray → Quit Swift, then in `overlay`:

   ```powershell
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

3. Wait for "Swift is ready". Note the time; the report uses it.

## The checks

| # | Do | You should see | Report checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Say "hey Swift, what time is it" | An answer, then "Listening for a reply… 8 s" under it | A wake request |
| 2 | Within 8 s, without "hey Swift": "and what's the date?" | The date answer on the **same card**, with the time answer as a dim line above it | Same thread as check 1 |
| 3 | Within 8 s again: "what day is it tomorrow?" | A third answer; the two before it as dim lines (at most two) | Three requests in one thread |
| 4 | "Hey Swift, set up a meeting with Test Me on Thursday at three" | **No** "I have a workflow for that"; it goes straight to a calendar card for Thursday 15:00. The working card says "Working on it" / "Thinking", never "Claude Code is…" | The calendar workflow ran directly |
| 5 | On that card, hold the hotkey and say "make it Friday at three instead" | "Changing it: …" on the working card, then a **new card** for Friday 15:00. Click **Reject**. | A change on the card (revise), then a rejection |
| 6 | Hands-free: "hey Swift, set up a meeting with Test Me on Monday at ten". On the card, say just "approve" | A hint: say "Swift, approve". The card stays. | (seen on screen only) |
| 7 | On the same card, say "no" | "Not approved", then "Listening for a reply…" | A rejection by voice |
| 8 | Within 8 s: "make it Tuesday at ten instead" | A **new card** for Tuesday 10:00, with "Not approved: …" above it. It **stays** until you answer. Say "Swift, approve". | A correction in the same thread, answered; **no timed-out card** |
| 9 | Check Google Calendar | Exactly one new event: Tuesday 10:00. Nothing for Thursday, Friday or Monday. Delete it afterwards. | (Google Calendar) |
| 10 | Hold the hotkey: "research the history of tea into Word", with Word open. During the run, say "show me", then "stop" | The run stops, "Cancelled" briefly, and nothing stays stuck on screen | A mid-run "show me" and "stop" |
| 11 | Put the laptop to sleep for a minute, or plug headphones in or out. Then, without the hotkey: "hey Swift, what time is it" | It answers. If it doesn't within a few seconds, wait 5 s and try once more, then note the time. | A wake request after the pause; microphone reopen events, if any |
| 12 | Lock the screen (Win + L). Hover the tray icon? You can't while locked, so: wait 10 s, unlock, then hover Swift's tray icon right away | While locked, Windows' microphone indicator goes off. After unlocking, the tooltip says "listening for 'hey Swift'" within a few seconds. | Presence: away (locked), then here (unlocked); microphone paused, then reopened |
| 13 | Right after unlocking, without the hotkey: "hey Swift, what time is it" | It answers, with no long first-time delay | A wake request soon after unlocking |

## After the checks: the report

From the repository root, with the time you noted in step 3 of "Before you start":

```powershell
uv run python spikes/owner_checks/report.py --since 20:00
```

It reads your local Swift logs, prints what happened request by request, and marks each check `PASS` or `NOT SEEN`. It only reads, and it prints only to your terminal. Paste its output into the chat. It includes your request transcripts, which are your own data, so skim them first if you like.

## If something goes wrong

Note the check number and the time. That's enough: the logs have the rest.
