# Swift

A voice overlay for Windows 11. Hold a hotkey, speak, and Swift sends the request to an existing agent (Claude Code, headless), showing progress and results in a transparent overlay that never takes keyboard focus.

**Status:** MVP Milestone 1 (overlay shell driven by a mock executor). The plan is [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md); the change of direction is recorded in [ADR-006](docs/decisions/ADR-006-voice-overlay-mvp.md). The original v2.0 spec, [`SWIFT_BUILD_PROMPT.md`](SWIFT_BUILD_PROMPT.md), is paused.

## Requirements (Windows 11)

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| Python 3.12 (64-bit) + [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | The backend runs from the repo's `.venv`. |
| Rust stable, MSVC target (`rustup`) | Builds the Tauri shell. |
| Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools, "Desktop development with C++" | Needed by Rust's MSVC target. |
| Node.js 20+ and npm | Frontend tooling; installed locally in `overlay/`. |
| WebView2 runtime | Ships with Windows 11. |

## Setup

From the repository root, in PowerShell:

```powershell
uv sync --frozen                  # backend dependencies into .venv
Copy-Item config.example.yaml config.yaml
cd overlay
npm ci                            # frontend + Tauri CLI, local to overlay/
```

If `uv` isn't on your PATH, it may be in `%APPDATA%\Python\Python313\Scripts`.

## Run (development)

```powershell
cd overlay
npm run tauri dev
```

The first build compiles the Rust side and takes several minutes; later runs are incremental. Build from PowerShell or cmd, not Git Bash: Git Bash's `/usr/bin/link` shadows the MSVC linker `link.exe` and the build fails with `link: extra operand`. Tauri starts the Python backend itself (`.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m swift.backend --config config.yaml`) inside a Job Object, so quitting Swift also stops the backend.

Overrides (environment variables, development only):

- `SWIFT_PYTHON`: a different Python interpreter for the backend.
- `SWIFT_ROOT`: the repository root, if the overlay was built elsewhere.
- `SWIFT_BACKEND_PORT` + `SWIFT_SESSION_TOKEN`: connect to a backend you started yourself, for example with `python -m swift.backend --token <32+ chars> --console`.
- `SWIFT_DEV_ALLOW_CAPTURE=1`: debug builds only. Leaves the overlay visible to screenshots so its rendering can be checked. Release builds always exclude it from capture.

The overlay's console prints `[overlay] …` diagnostics (placement, hotkeys, click-through changes).

### UI-only harness (no Rust needed)

`overlay/dev/harness.html` runs the overlay UI in an ordinary browser, with a stand-in for Tauri, against a backend you start yourself:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m swift.backend --config config.yaml --port 8765 --token devharness-token-0123456789abcdef --console
npm --prefix overlay run dev
# open http://localhost:1420/dev/harness.html?port=8765&token=devharness-token-0123456789abcdef
# in the browser console: __shim.emit("hotkey", {name: "debug", state: "down"})
```

It tests rendering and the protocol only. Window behavior (focus, click-through, capture exclusion) needs the real Tauri build.

## Milestone 1: what to try

With `debug: true` in `config.yaml`, press **Ctrl+Alt+F12**. Each press plays the next scenario: `happy` → `confirm` → `error` → `long`. Each one shows the listening orb with a fake mic level, then the transcript and the working steps, and ends on a result or error card.

- **Esc** cancels while Swift is listening, working or waiting for approval. Swift only claims Esc during those states.
- On the confirm card, **Approve** and **Reject** are clickable. Everywhere else, clicks pass through to the window below.
- Result cards fade after 6 s and error cards after 8 s. Hovering pauses the timer, and clicking a card dismisses it.
- **Quit:** tray icon → *Quit Swift*.

## Tests

```powershell
uv run pytest                     # Python: protocol, executor contract, session, server, settings
cd overlay; npm run typecheck     # TypeScript
cd overlay/src-tauri; cargo test  # Rust: hit-testing geometry
```

## Logs and data

Everything stays on this machine:

- **App log:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Swift\logs\swift.log`, with secrets and transcripts redacted.
- **Interaction log (JSONL, from Milestone 4):** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Swift\interactions.jsonl`.
